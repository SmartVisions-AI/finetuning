      "Okay, so I need to figure out how Polish tourists aged 38 in February 2022 viewed the mask requirement during their trip to Austria. Hmm, first, I should consider the context. February 2022 was around the time when COVID-19 was still a major concern, but maybe some countries were easing restrictions. I think Austria might have had mask mandates in places, especially in public transport or indoor areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Polish tourists might have mixed feelings. On one hand, they're used to mask requirements since Poland likely had similar rules, so they might comply without much hassle. But depending on how strictly the Austrian measures were enforced, they might have had issues, like mask mishaps or frustration if they felt badly treated.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also think about the travel context. If people were vaccinated or not, that could affect their perspective. If they were fully vaccinated, they might be more comfortable with the rules. But if there were strict enforcement, maybe they felt burdened, especially if they weren\n",
